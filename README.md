# Blogster
 Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
 
“Blogster” is blog responsive app where you as a registered user can create, delete and edit your posts. You can also comment on posts and “buy” products. Throughout this project I have used PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Redis, Express.js and Angular.
